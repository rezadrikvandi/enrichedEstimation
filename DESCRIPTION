Description: This package implements the enriched estimation and inference for high dimensional data. The main function is called "enrichedInference" which applies both the enriched estimation and inference. 
             Also, a test data set is included together with the real data set "riboflavin" analysed in the paper. 
             To apply the enriched method to the real data (riboflavin data with n=71 and p=4088) in the package, try the following: 
             enrichedInference(X=riboflavin$x, Y=riboflavin$y, k=1, Xcorr="marginal", Bonf.correction=TRUE)
             enrichedInference(X=riboflavin$x, Y=riboflavin$y,k=1, Xcorr="partial", Bonf.correction=TRUE)
             Also, to apply the enriched method to the testdata in the package (with n=100, p=500 and the first three covariates being truly significant each with coefficient 1, try this command: 
             enrichedInference(X=testdata[,-1], Y=testdata[,1], intercept=FALSE, Xcorr="marginal")
